## About
This project is based on the Kaggle Playground Series – Season 5, Episode 12, where I develop and evaluate machine learning models to make predictions on the competition dataset.

- Goal : Predict the probability that a patient will be diagnosed with diabetes.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) between the predicted probability and the observed target.
